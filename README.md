Research Proposal Assignment Sheet and Rubric
Fall   Semester,   2024
You will submit a   1500 to 2000-word research proposal   on   any   topic   related   to   language   and   communication.
•          Proposals   outside   this   range   (not   counting   references)   may   receive   a   deduction. N.b.,   the word   length   range   means   that   there   is   no   ±10% applicable   to   this   assignment.
•             Given the scope of   the subject, you are   expected to   choose   a method   that has been   covered   in   class   and   to propose a research study that meets these   criteria.
•          You   should   adopt   a   research paradigm   and   work   clearly   within   that paradigm.   It   does not matter   which   one you choose as long as there is   consistency between   the proposed research   study, research   questions,   and methodology, and your chosen paradigm.
•          The   proposal   can be   written with   your   Capstone   Project   in   mind.   You   will not   be   bound   to   do   this
proposal for your capstone but your research proposal needs to be a feasible project of   the   scope of   a   capstone.
This proposal must include the following   5   sections:
Abstract
•                A summary of   the research proposal in   150 words, similar to published   article   abstracts.   Introduction
For this section, you are strongly advised to   follow   the   structure we   have used   in   class   from   the   work   of   Swales   (i.e., Moves   1 – 3)—consult   the   files
ENGL3002_Week04_PlanningResProposal.pptx and   ConstructingLitReview_Territory.pdf,
from Week 4. These are from the seminar   class   on planning your research proposal.   Follow   the   steps in those   documents
•                Begin with a clear statement of   the topic of   your proposal   and why   it   is   important
•                Move onto the research that has been done in this   area   and   suggest where the   gaps   are   in   this literature.

cannot simply take the results of   studies done elsewhere at   face value?
•                Finally, occupy the niche! Point out how your research question   flows   from the
arguments that you have made above—make sure your research question/s is/are clearly   stated.
•                Engagement with existing theory/literature
•          You   need   to   cite   at   least   6   appropriate   academic   sources,   of   which   at   least   2   need   to   have   been   published   in   2023 or   2024)
•               in your reference list, you will need to provide hyperlinks through the DOIs to the   actual research papers for all references
Method
•                a clear and appropriate method that relates   directly   to   the   RQ
•                including a sound and specific rationale   for the   chosen   research   method   vs   others   Expected findings
•                believable expected findings   References
•                All   cited   references   to   be   presented   in   APA7 format
Proposals   are   due   via   Blackboard   on   December   2nd   at   11:59pm
•                All proposals will be scanned via Turnitin at submission.   There   is no   single   cutoff   number that   is used to   determine possible plagiarism. This   judgement is made via the report that is produced.
•                You must submit using a format such   as Microsoft   Word   that   can be read by   Turnitin.   You will not   be   deemed to have submitted until your file has been received and successfully   scanned by   Turnitin   via Blackboard.
